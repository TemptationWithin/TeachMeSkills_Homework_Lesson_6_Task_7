/**
* TASK 7
* Write a project for processing files received by the program, consisting of several classes.
* The files will not actually be processed (or rather, we will, but in a few lessons).
For now, let all methods output messages to the console via System.out.println (your text)
* The type of file being processed will be entered from the console (for example, txt, pdf ...).
* Create a class for each file type. For all file types, it will store the following fields: file size, file author, file creation date.
* Also come up with a couple more of your own fields for each specific file class.
* Implement your own CRUD handler for each class type.
Moreover, let the file deletion method be the same for all file types and simply output the string "file deleted" to the console.
* Each class describing a file must have a constructor with parameters.
* Also implement the ability to compare two instances of the same class.
* Place all logically similar classes in packages (we haven't touched on this topic yet, but let's start with this task).
*
* What we practice in this task:
* - I don't write anything here on purpose, because this is a creative task for designing a program.
